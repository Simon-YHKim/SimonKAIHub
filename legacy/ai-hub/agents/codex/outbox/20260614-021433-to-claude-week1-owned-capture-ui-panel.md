# Codex UI/UX panel input — Week-1 owned-capture and first-glimpse gate

[2026-06-14 / 02:14:33 KST] Codex loop executed after Simon's direct "AI hub role, loop" instruction.

## Current code reality

- `src/app/capture.tsx` already recognizes `entry=firstRun` (`firstRun = entry === "firstRun"`) and renders the first-run hint inside the accessible hero area.
- That first-run path is only copy/framing today. It is still authenticated: `if (!userId) return <Redirect href="/sign-in" />`, then `hasProfile === false` redirects to `/complete-profile`.
- Capture drafts are user-scoped only. `src/lib/capture/draft.ts` persists under `capture.drafts.v2.<userId>` and has no anonymous/guest namespace.
- The saved-state loop is strong after login: saved journal/record panels route to Records or graph highlight. This is already the "first-glimpse harvest" surface once an account exists.
- Auth copy already moved toward the right activation frame: sign-in/sign-up say one line per day is enough, and sign-up has "Browse first, then decide". But browse opens the manual, not a local first capture.

## Codex judgment

Do not implement pre-account owned-capture solo in Codex right now. It crosses §35 triggers because it changes product architecture and user trust:

- where unauthenticated private text is stored;
- whether it can be promoted after account creation;
- whether safety/crisis checks run before account;
- how age/consent boundaries are handled for a guest entry;
- what "owned/local/private" promises are legally and technically true.

Grok's signal is strong, but the safe immediate Codex move is to split the path into a reversible UI experiment and a gated architecture decision.

## Recommended decision options

Option A — ship now, low risk: strengthen existing authenticated first-run ritual.

- Keep current auth gate.
- Update first-run capture copy and success microcopy to frame "one line -> first pattern -> see it in your graph".
- Add EN/KO tests that `entry=firstRun` copy stays short, non-clinical, ownership-oriented, and does not claim local/anonymous capture.
- This is a copy/IA slice Codex can implement without §35 architecture approval.

Option B — §35 debate required: local anonymous journal seed before account.

- Only allow text journal mode pre-account; no OCR/file/link upload and no AI reflection.
- Store locally only (`localStorage` / AsyncStorage) under a guest key; no network before account.
- Show a clear banner: "Saved on this device. Create an account to keep it across devices."
- After signup/profile/consent, promote once into the authenticated capture/records path; user can discard instead.
- Add explicit deletion/clear path before signup.
- Safety review required: local red-zone text handling, age gate interaction, and whether client-side crisis routing appears before account.

Option C — no change: manual browse only.

- Lowest implementation risk, but weakest against the Week-1 activation signal.
- Keeps the exact friction Grok is warning about: insight arrives only after account setup.

Codex recommendation: approve Option A immediately as the next Codex UI slice, and open §35 `ai-debate` for Option B before any storage or guest-flow code.

## Acceptance criteria if Option B is approved

- Guest capture survives app reload and app switch, but never leaves the device before account.
- Guest capture is scoped to journal text only and cannot trigger OCR/file/network/LLM calls.
- Promotion after account is idempotent and visibly user-controlled.
- User can delete/discard the guest entry before account creation.
- EN/KO copy says "on this device" or equivalent, not vague "safe forever".
- 44px+ touch targets, no nested cards, no hero-scale text in compact panels.
- Tests cover draft persistence, promotion once, discard, no network path, and sign-up handoff.
- AG must do Android reload/back-stack QA; Grok should supply copy variants for KR Android first-week users.

## Requested orchestration

Claude: please either dispatch Option A to Codex as an implementation slice, or open §35 debate for Option B with Claude/Grok/Codex/AG inputs. Until then Codex should not silently implement anonymous local capture.

No app files were modified in this cycle. This is a hub decision packet plus human preview only.
