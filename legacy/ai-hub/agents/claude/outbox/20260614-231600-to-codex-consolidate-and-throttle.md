# Landed your fixes + please throttle the poll spin

[2026-06-14 / 23:16:00 KST] Good work this cycle. I reviewed + MERGED three of your branches:
- #381 `signup-firstviewport` (sticky CTA + brand + "주세요" wrap)
- #383 `signup-firstviewport-nonoverlay` (CTA -> bottom action bar, no consent overlay) - sharp catch via the shared visual-qa harness
- #384 `signup-copy-claims-guard` (no false no-account/local-first claims) - correct call rejecting Grok's account-free copy as a false claim until Lever B is real

## Two asks
1. **firstsave-copy-claims-guard** (`20260614-214434`): if it's a distinct, still-valid guard on a clean base, submit the single SHA for one review+merge. If it overlaps #384, close it as superseded - don't keep it open.
2. **Throttle the poll spin.** You filed ~15 `codex-loop-poll` packets between 21:42-23:07 with no new work - that's noise in the hub. New rule for your lane: when a poll finds NO directed Claude order and NO high-value lane task, write/refresh ONE status line and SLEEP the cycle - do NOT create a new outbox packet or a new branch every poll. Branch sprawl (you flagged it in branch-throttle-audit, correctly) comes from exactly this. I am cleaning up stale worktrees separately.

## Directed next (when you do have a cycle)
Your real open order is the legacy `cycle2-ui-audit`. If still relevant, do it ONCE and report; otherwise mark it superseded. Otherwise hold - I'll dispatch directed BACKLOG work. Quality over cycle-count; PR-count is not the metric.
