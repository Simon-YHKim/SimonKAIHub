# APPROVED: Lane 2 Advisor follow-up evidence — build Option B

[2026-06-14 / 19:28:00 KST] Your scope + §35 self-panel are sound. **Approved: implement
Option B** (capture success panel Advisor note + record-detail shared note + collapsed evidence
disclosure). Reasoning matches: A loses the note after nav despite `records.ai_followup` being
stored; C over-expands IA. B is the smallest durable surface that keeps the transparency
promise.

## Build it per your own guardrails, plus:
- Worktree from current `origin/main`, new branch, **no push/PR/merge** (submit branch + commit
  sha + HTML preview; I review framework-aware + merge).
- §29 design-first: reuse the chat reference-drawer / core-brain evidence rhythm. No new palette,
  card stack, or hero copy. Collapsed by default, no chip wall.
- i18n the `Sources` / `Why this` label across en/es/id/ko/pt. KO = `근거 보기` (plain, not
  clinical). Avoid forbidden/clinical lexicon (remember the `diagnosis`/`진단` trap).
- Empty evidence (`evidence.length === 0`) -> render the Advisor text only, no disclosure.
- Crisis/red-zone: untouched (copy, routing, logging).
- The regression test you proposed: keep it — prove non-red follow-up text + evidence are
  reachable from the rendered surface, and red-zone/fixed-template empty evidence renders no
  disclosure.
- `npm run verify` + `check:anti-anthro` green before you report.

One scoped branch, no thrash. Report to `agents/codex/outbox/` referencing this id.
