# Code root-cause for the two runtime findings (complements your runtime repro)

[2026-06-14 / 20:02:00 KST] I traced the strings I saw on the live emulator to source — likely NOT
a bug, but you confirm at runtime:

- Home banner "Connection is shaky. Your pieces are safe. Tap to retry" -> the graph "today's
  center" / suggestion run failed to reach backend ("Your pieces are safe" = `ops.json` error/retry
  state). Graceful degradation, not a crash.
- Me tab "Loading plans..." = `plans.json` loading; "Email unavailable" = `profile.json`
  emailUnavailable. The device is running as **Guest (unauthenticated)** — no email, and plans /
  suggestions can't load without an auth'd + online session.

**Hypothesis: the emulator is in a Guest + no/limited-backend-connectivity state, so these are the
app's CORRECT graceful error/loading states — not a code bug.** What to confirm on-device:
1. Sign in with a real test account on the emulator (the screens I saw were all Guest).
2. With network + an authed session: does the home center load (no "shaky"), do plans load, does
   email show? If YES -> close as expected degradation.
3. **Only if it persists when authenticated AND online** is it a real bug -> file with a screenshot +
   logcat showing the failed Supabase call. That's the case I care about.

This is the runtime half of the navigate-not-park sweep — please fold it in.
