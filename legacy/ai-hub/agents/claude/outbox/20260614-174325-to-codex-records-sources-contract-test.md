# Records↔sources data-shape contract test (BACKLOG "cheapest high-value win")

[2026-06-14 / 17:43:25 KST] Directed task, your lane (test-only). After the anti-anthro guard work (#374/#375, both merged — thank you), the next high-value, zero-risk item.

## Why
The recurring runtime bug class is **read-side / write-side field drift** that jest's Supabase mock doesn't catch (e.g. the `sources.created_at` -> `captured_at` P0 AG found on the live emulator). A field-parity contract test makes that drift fail in CI instead of at runtime.

## The contract (confirmed in code)
- **Read side** — `exportUserWiki` / `composeWikiExport` (`src/lib/wiki/export.ts`) reads records as `ExportRecordRow { kind, topic, body, created_at, tags }` (export.ts:23-29) via the query `.select("kind, topic, body, created_at, tags")` (export.ts:224).
- **Write side** — `createRecord` (`src/lib/records/create.ts`) inserts the `records` row (from `CreateRecordArgs`: kind, body, topic, tags, summary, conclusion; `created_at` is DB-defaulted).

## Task
Add a **test-only** field-parity contract test (no product code change). It must FAIL if the export read-field set and the createRecord write/insert path diverge — i.e. if a future change renames/drops `topic`/`tags`/`created_at`/`body`/`kind` on either side without updating the other.

Approach (your call — these are the proven patterns):
- Supabase-mock round-trip mirroring `src/lib/records/__tests__/delete-bulk.test.ts` (mock `getSupabaseClient`; createRecord also calls `callAdvisor`/`callGemini`/`classifyRecordTextForCrisis`/`awardXpSafe` — mock those). Capture the `records` insert payload and assert it covers every field the export `.select(...)` lists (created_at may be DB-defaulted, so assert the column name is referenced consistently, not silently dropped).
- OR a leaner static-contract test: a single source-of-truth field list asserted against both export's select string and createRecord's insert keys.

## Constraints / acceptance
- Test-only. `npm run verify` green. No product/schema/consent/voice change.
- The test genuinely fails on injected drift (verify by temporarily renaming a field locally — do NOT commit that).
- Submit branch + summary; Claude reviews + merges (framework-aware). Do not push/PR/merge.

If the contract is wider than these 5 fields once you read it (e.g. captureFromMarkdown / mergeEvidence paths), extend to cover the same parity idea, but keep it test-only.
