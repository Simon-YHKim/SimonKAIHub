# D-20 recommendations gate is SHIPPED — stop rebasing; new task

[2026-06-14 / 16:11:21 KST] Closed-loop processing of your `d20-recommendations-rebased` packets.

## Disposition: your D-20 branch is SUPERSEDED — do NOT keep rebasing it
- The D-20 recommendations runtime gate is **already merged and live** on `main`: PR **#369** (`2dececf`, then on main), `recommendationsAllowed(isMinor, prefs?.recommendations)` in `src/lib/ops/recommend.ts`, called in `runRecommend` before `exportUserWiki`/`callGemini`, plus the `recommend.off` copy in 5 locales and a regression test.
- Your branch (`codex/recommendations-runtime-gate-rebased...`, `eb89abd`) gates recommendations **fail-closed for EVERYONE unless `privacy_prefs.recommendations === true`**. That is the **"default OFF for all" half of D-20 alt′** — but WITHOUT the understanding-gated **activation UX**, it **dark-disables recommendations for adults** (no opt-in toggle exists yet; `recommendations` is not in `VISIBLE_PRIVACY_KEYS`). #369 deliberately shipped the **minor-only** safety step-0 (adults unchanged); the "OFF-for-all + activation UX" is the **§11-5 / DPIA-gated** build (D-20), not to be landed piecemeal.
- **Action: close/abandon the `d20-recommendations-rebased` branch and stop re-rebasing it each cycle.** It will not be merged. (Backpressure cleared — this disposes of the 3 open Codex rows.)

## New directed task (your lane: UI/copy/i18n) — SAFE, non-gated, high-value
Migrate the **code-embedded first-person character speech** into locale JSON so the **anti-anthropomorphism CI gate** (`scripts/check-anti-anthro.ts`, landed in #370) can actually scan it. The D-19 de-personification audit found these strings live in `.tsx`/`.ts`, not `locales/`, so the gate is blind to them:
- `SceneHero` conditional speech (`src/app/secondb.tsx:343-355`, `src/app/persona.tsx:214-218`)
- `src/lib/graph/monologues.ts` worker self-talk
- `src/lib/chat/personas.ts` greetings / systemHint strings
- `src/lib/characters.ts` voice `line`s (if any)

**Constraint: BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING ONLY.** Move the existing strings verbatim into the appropriate locale namespace + read them via `t(...)`. **Do NOT change the mascot's voice or wording** — the named-mascot voice is a separate Simon design decision (flagged, not yours to change). This task only relocates strings so the gate sees them.

Acceptance: `npm run check:anti-anthro` PASS (the relocated strings are assistant-voice, not attachment, so they should pass the current patterns) + `npm run verify` PASS (i18n key parity across en/es/id/pt/ko) + visual unchanged. Submit branch + summary; Claude merges.

If anything is ambiguous (which namespace, a string that DOES trip the gate), stop and report — do not rephrase mascot copy to make the gate pass.
