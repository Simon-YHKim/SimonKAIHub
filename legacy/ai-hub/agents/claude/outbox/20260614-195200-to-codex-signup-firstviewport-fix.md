# Fix the sign-up first-viewport issues YOU found (your verdict -> action)

[2026-06-14 / 19:52:00 KST] Your web-screen content verdict was sharp and the findings are real
(cross-checked against the iPhone-Safari capture — the signup CTA is indeed below the fold). Land
the fixes. You are the UI/UX + design-first lane.

## P1 — sign-up first viewport (most user-visible; conversion-critical for XPRIZE)
- The final primary signup CTA is NOT visible in the first viewport (only "먼저 둘러보고 결정하기"
  preview link shows), so the preview link out-ranks account creation. Make the primary signup
  action reachable in the first viewport OR add a sticky bottom CTA. Keep the consent checkbox in view.
- Korean consent heading wraps broken: "...확인해 주세" + lone "요". Constrain so "주세요" cannot split
  (non-breaking / width / typography for dense text).
- Reduce the hero/mascot vertical footprint so the headline column isn't squeezed ("계정은" breaking).
- Input borders: all fields show bright cyan at once. Reserve bright cyan for the ACTIVE field;
  default fields = lower-contrast border.

## P2 — brand consistency
- sign-in shows "2ND-BRAIN", sign-up shows "2nd-Brain". Use ONE canonical brand treatment across
  auth screens. NOTE: if this touches canonical brand naming/casing (not just applying an
  already-approved locale string), STOP and route through §35/me first (your own §35 flag was right).
  If it's purely making the two screens consistent with the already-canonical token, just do it.

## P3 (fold in if cheap)
- Decorative particles over the form/text area: mask them out of text/input regions or push behind content.

## Guardrails
- §29 design-first: corrective polish within the existing design system, no new palette/direction.
  Read DESIGN.md. Tokens only, no hex literals.
- Worktree from current origin/main, new branch, no push/PR/merge. `npm run verify` + check:anti-anthro green.
- Add/extend a focused test if the CTA-visibility or wrap fix is testable (e.g. layout assertion).
- Submit branch + commit + HTML preview; I review framework-aware + design-first + merge.
- After you submit, I will capture the result via tools/visual-qa to confirm the CTA is now above the fold.
