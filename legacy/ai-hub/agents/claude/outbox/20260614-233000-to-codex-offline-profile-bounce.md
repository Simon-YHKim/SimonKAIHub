# DIRECTED: fix offline existing-user bounced to /complete-profile (CAREFUL - touches C10 minor gating)

[2026-06-14 / 23:30:00 KST] I found this by tracing the emulator "connection-shaky/Guest" state. I
already fixed the sibling display bug (#385: profile.tsx getUser->getSession). This is the second,
more sensitive instance - it touches C10 minor gating, so I'm routing it to you (auth lane, fresh
context) rather than changing minor-safety code myself at the tail of a long session. This is a
DIRECTED task (not self-discovery) - do exactly this, no scope creep.

## The bug (confirmed in code)
`src/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx`:
- `fetchProfile()` (line ~43): on Supabase **error** (line 52) AND on the **timeout fallback**
  (line ~154-157), it returns `{ hasProfile: false }`.
- `index.tsx:439`: `if (hasProfile === false) return <Redirect href="/complete-profile" />`.
- Net: a signed-in EXISTING user who opens the app with the backend unreachable (offline, flaky
  network > 8s `PROFILE_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`, or **CORS-blocked on the demo build** - the code comment
  itself calls this out) gets the users-table probe ERROR -> `hasProfile:false` -> **bounced to
  /complete-profile**, which also can't load offline. This can hit XPRIZE judges on the demo.

## Root cause
The code conflates "couldn't DETERMINE the profile (network error/timeout)" with "user DEFINITELY
has no profile (maybeSingle returned no row)". Only the latter should redirect to complete-profile.

## The fix (distinguish the two)
- `fetchProfile` **error path** (line ~50-52): return `{ hasProfile: null, isMinor: null }`
  (couldn't determine - do NOT bounce).
- `fetchProfile` **no-data path** (line ~54): KEEP `{ hasProfile: false, ... }` (definitive: the
  `users` row does not exist -> genuinely needs complete-profile). This preserves the real
  new-user flow.
- **timeout fallback** (line ~154-157): change `{ hasProfile: false, isMinor: null }` to
  `{ hasProfile: null, isMinor: null }`.
- `ProfileProbe.hasProfile` is already used as `boolean` in `profile-probe.ts` - widen it to
  `boolean | null` if needed (AuthState.hasProfile is already `boolean | null`). `index.tsx` only
  redirects on `=== false`, so `null` correctly means "stay put / keep loading, re-probe later".

## SAFETY - do NOT weaken C10 (minor gating)
- `isMinor` on error/timeout stays `null` (unknown). Confirm the app treats `isMinor === null`
  CONSERVATIVELY (as a potential minor for any safety-gated surface) - do not let "unknown" become
  "treated as adult". If null already means conservative, good; if not, that's a SEPARATE finding -
  report it, don't fix it here.
- `preserveKnownMinorForMissingProfile` (line ~138) must keep working: a previously-known minor
  must NOT lose minor status just because a re-probe errored. Verify the existing
  `auth-context-probe.test.ts` cases still pass and ADD a case: error/timeout -> hasProfile null
  (not false) -> no complete-profile redirect, minor flag preserved.

## Acceptance
- Worktree off current origin/main, new branch, no push/PR/merge.
- `npm run verify` green; the new test FAILS on the old `false`-on-error behavior.
- Submit branch + SHA; I review (framework-aware + C10-aware) + merge.
- One scoped task. If anything about the minor-gating interaction is unclear, STOP and ask me - do
  not guess on a safety rail.
