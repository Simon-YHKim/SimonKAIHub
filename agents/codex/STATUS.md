# Codex STATUS

## Current (latest)

- **작업**: Simon 지시 `/goal`에 따라 모든 화면 UI/UX와 AI slop를 100/100 기준으로 반복 게이트 중. Claude/AG의 최신 앱 커밋 `89eeaaa`를 즉시 재검수했다.
- **src**: user - "AI slop는 점수가 100점 이 되는것을 지향해. 클로드가 관련 작업을 완료하면 리뷰하고 의견주기를 완벽해질때까지 반복해. /goal"
- **앱 기준**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `claude/cycle-2-concept-consistency`, committed head remains `121bc87`; `origin/main` 대비 ahead 5. Current dirty WIP: `src/app/inbox.tsx`, `src/app/records.tsx`, `src/app/wiki.tsx`.
- **검증**: committed `121bc87` re-gate passed earlier, but current FlatList WIP fails `npm run verify` at ESLint due `src/app/wiki.tsx` conditional hook-order errors.
- **현재 점수**: committed `121bc87` score remains 91/100 provisional. Current FlatList WIP is unscored and P0-blocked; if committed as-is it fails the gate.
- **최신 산출물**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-021454-to-claude-flatlist-wip-p0-preflight.md`

  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-015756-89eeaaa-perf-regate.html`
- **대기**: Claude/AG가 FlatList/perf WIP P0 hook-order failure를 고치고 커밋/완료 보고하면 즉시 재게이트. 100점 전까지 반복.

[FlatList WIP P0 preflight / 26.06.06 / 02:14:54]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #flatlist #preflight #p0
- Reviewed current dirty FlatList/perf WIP in `inbox`, `records`, `wiki`; no app code modified by Codex.
- Ran `npm run verify`: failed at ESLint.
- P0: `src/app/wiki.tsx` new `useCallback` hooks are after auth/no-profile early returns, violating `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` at lines 207, 242, 270, 316, 319, 322, 326.
- P1: WIP still leaves raw error message exposure in inbox/wiki visible state/alerts.
- P2: FlatList spacing/scroll behavior needs visual proof before final score.
- Report/preview written and opened.

- Reviewed current uncommitted WIP on app head `89eeaaa`; no app code modified by Codex.
- Initial `npm run verify` failed because tests still expected visible `[MOCK]`; Claude/WIP tests updated during review.
- Reran `npm run verify`: pass, 91 suites, 823 tests.
- Accepted direction: support clinical FAQ fixed, user-visible `[MOCK]` removed, Phase 1 mostly changed to Source brief / 요약과 질문, assessment scale hit targets improved, KO eyebrow tracking improved.
- Still blocking 100: persona visible "진단이 아니며 / Not a diagnosis", raw errors across multiple routes, consent legal placeholder readiness, LivingAsset AppState perf edge, small hitSlop leftovers.

[Claude WIP detected after 89eeaaa / 26.06.06 / 02:01:45]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #claude-wip
- After committing Codex report `5994d7b`, app worktree became dirty on the same head `89eeaaa`.
- Dirty files overlap Codex blockers: support FAQ, raw error paths, mock/phase1 paths, assessment microtype/tap-target surfaces, consent copy, account/privacy/capture/inbox/manual.
- Waited twice for completion; no new app commit or Claude outbox completion yet.
- Do not score WIP. Next action is immediate re-gate once Claude commits/reports completion.

## Current

- **작업**: Simon 지시 - 모든 화면 UI/UX와 AI slop를 100/100 기준으로 반복 게이트. Claude 완료물은 즉시 재리뷰하고, 100점 전까지 outbox로 의견을 계속 남긴다.
- **src**: user - "AI slop는 점수가 100점 이 되는것을 지향해. 클로드가 관련 작업을 완료하면 리뷰하고 의견주기를 완벽해질때까지 반복해. /goal"
- **최신 Claude 기준**: `agents/claude/outbox/20260606-013358-to-all-cycle2-audit-baseline.md`, committed spec fix `7ee23ce` (Lumi -> Iris), and `agents/claude/outbox/20260606-014743-to-all-cycle2-perf-audit.md` assigning Codex to include perf items in cycle-2 re-gate.
- **검사 기준**: SimonK-stack `simon-design-first`, `design-review`, `design-consultation`, `design-html`를 참고하되 2nd-B 기존 `DESIGN.md` dark premium/village system을 보존. 사용자에게 보이는 mock/stub/placeholder/coming-soon, 권한 불일치, unproven provider, keyboard/list proof gap, source-of-truth split, stale worldview residue를 100점 감점 요인으로 본다.
- **대상 앱 상태**:
  - App worktree `E:\2ndB` branch `claude/cycle-2-concept-consistency`, clean, head `71f44fe` (ahead 2 from `origin/main`).
- **검증**: `npm run verify` pass on `71f44fe`: lint/type-check/i18n/lexicon/constraints/emdash/tests green, 91 suites, 823 tests.
- **현재 점수**: 71f44fe UI re-gate = 88/100 provisional. Placeholder/permission/MBTI/BackArrow fixes are accepted, but 100/100 remains blocked by support FAQ vocabulary policy violation, raw error alerts, user-visible mock-mode strings, unproven social provider affordances, consent/legal launch readiness, assessment tap-target proof, internal "Phase 1" labels, stale worldview residue, keyboard/list proof, and Claude's new perf-gate items (FlatList, NavGraph LOD, background timers, memory prune).

[71f44fe UI re-gate / 26.06.06 / 01:52:30]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #cycle2 #regate #claude-commit
- Reviewed app commit `71f44fe fix(ui): cycle-2 Codex gap fixes`.
- Ran `npm run verify`: pass, 91 suites, 823 tests.
- Accepted closed/improved items: password reset coming-soon, free journal subscription placeholder, device reset placeholder, permission copy, `/mbti` redirect, BackArrow labels, support placeholder FAQ.
- New P1: support FAQ uses vocabulary policy violations (`진단이나 치료`, `diagnoses or treats`) despite lexicon check passing.
- Still open: raw implementation error alerts, user-visible mock strings, "Phase 1" internal labels, assessment tap targets, positive tracking, consent/legal launch readiness, provider gating/proof, perf items.
- Score adjusted up to 88/100 provisional, still below 90.
- Report/preview written and opened.

[All-screen trust/state ledger / 26.06.06 / 01:46:20]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #cycle2 #trust #state #regate
- Continued all-screen audit on app head `f1ced87`.
- Observed Claude hub commit `7ee23ce` fixing `CONCEPT-SPEC-2ndb-worldview.md` Lumina -> Iris; Codex did not stage or touch Claude file.
- Read Claude perf FYI `20260606-014743-to-all-cycle2-perf-audit.md`; future 100-point gate now includes perf items too.
- Added new P1/P2 ledger beyond previous route/mock audit: consent/legal placeholder and best-effort ledger, raw implementation error alerts, small assessment scale hitSlop/tap-target proof, internal "Phase 1" user-facing labels, and microtype positive tracking.
- Score adjusted to 84/100 provisional under stricter all-screen trust/state standard.
- Report/preview written and opened.

[Cycle-2.1 AI slop re-gate / 26.06.06 / 01:39:07]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #cycle2 #claude-request #regate
- Reviewed Claude FYI `20260606-013358-to-all-cycle2-audit-baseline.md` and app commit `f1ced87`.
- Accepted: `Iris` is intentional per Simon decision; `f1ced87` is comment-only and safe.
- Ran `npm run verify` on `f1ced87`: pass, 91 suites, 823 tests.
- Score adjusted to 87/100 provisional. Cannot exceed 90 until user-visible P1 mock/placeholder/permission/provider issues close.
- New finding: Vela cleanup is partial (`src/lib/motion/signature.ts:6`, `src/app/jarvis.tsx:246`, `BackArrow.tsx`, tab-bar comments).
- New finding: source-of-truth split remains because Claude FYI says Iris but `CONCEPT-SPEC-2ndb-worldview.md:38` still says Lumina.
- Report/preview written and opened.

[Route/mock entry audit / 26.06.06 / 01:32:20]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #cycle2 #mock #route-entry #claude-request
- Additional audit on merged main `0bfbfa3`, branch `claude/cycle-2-concept-consistency`, clean.
- Created route navigation-hit matrix from route files and actual `router.push/replace`, `Link href`, `route:` references.
- P1: `EXPO_PUBLIC_LLM_MODE` defaults to `mock` without key; mock responses include `[MOCK]`, `stub`, `Gemini key`, and are surfaced by chat/wiki flows. This is user-visible AI slop in public no-key builds.
- P1: `/support` still has FAQ placeholder "A help center is on the way."
- P1/P2: Google/Apple/Kakao auth buttons are always visible; Naver is config-gated. Primary auth providers need live proof or config-gated UI.
- P2: `/mbti` route has zero navigation hits. `/inbox`, `/insights`, `/trinity` are reachable but low-discoverability, mostly buried under profile.
- Score adjusted from 88 to 86 until mock/public-build UX is resolved.
- Report/preview written and opened.

[Cycle-2 UI audit / 26.06.06 / 01:25:24]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #cycle2 #claude-request
- Read Claude request `20260606-012034-to-codex-cycle2-ui-audit.md` and source-of-truth `CONCEPT-SPEC-2ndb-worldview.md`.
- Reviewed merged main `0bfbfa3` from `E:\2ndB` branch `claude/cycle-2-concept-consistency`.
- Ran `npm run verify`: pass, 91 suites, 823 tests.
- Score: 88/100 provisional. No P0 crash found, but not 100.
- P1: source-of-truth says Muse character is `Lumina`; code/tests/assets still use `Iris`.
- P1: reachable placeholder/coming-soon flows remain in password reset, subscription upsell, and device reset.
- P1: app permission declarations and `/permissions` copy conflict on camera/photo/storage.
- P1: main still has raw long `ScrollView` list surfaces and raw keyboard-sensitive destructive forms.
- P2: `/mbti` route is orphaned, several assessment/account routes have no BackArrow label, and tab/back comments retain stale "공상/five tabs" residue.
- Report/preview written and opened.

[WIP touch-action gate / 26.06.06 / 01:15:22]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #wip #touch #claude-request
- Reviewed current dirty WIP on top of `e29f1d1`.
- Files: `src/app/+html.tsx`, `src/app/capture.tsx`, `src/components/graph/NavGraph.tsx`, untracked `refactor_wiki.py`.
- P1 if committed: `+html.tsx` changes global `touch-action` from `pan-x pan-y` to `none`. This must be scoped to the graph surface or proven on mobile web across long list/input routes.
- Acceptable direction with proof: `<base href="/2nd-B/">` likely aligns GitHub Pages base path, but should be verified with refresh/deep link/static asset loading.
- Capture WIP is mostly no-op/proof-needed: `keyboardVerticalOffset={0}` adds no behavior, `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="never"` needs iOS/capture keyboard screenshot.
- NavGraph WIP is plausible but proof-needed: viewport resize re-clamp and offHome debounce need web/native pan/zoom/reset proof.
- P2: remove untracked root `refactor_wiki.py` before PR; it is a mechanical migration script residue.
- Report/preview written and opened.

[FlatList follow-up gate / 26.06.06 / 01:11:14]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #flatlist #android #claude-request
- Read Antigravity report `20260606-010559-to-claude-android-performance-fix-report.md`.
- Reviewed app commit `e29f1d1 perf(android): migrate lists to FlatList to prevent OOM`.
- Accepted direction: `records`, `inbox`, `wiki` now use `FlatList` with `initialNumToRender=10`, `maxToRenderPerBatch=10`, `windowSize=5`, `removeClippedSubviews=true`.
- Ran `npm run verify` on current branch/WIP: pass, 91 suites, 823 tests. `git diff --check` pass.
- P2 cleanup: lint warnings remain for unused `ScrollView` in `src/app/inbox.tsx` and unused `SafeAreaView` in `src/components/premium/background.tsx`.
- P1 WIP risk: current dirty `src/app/+html.tsx` changes global `touch-action` from `pan-x pan-y` to `none`; if committed, this needs mobile web scroll proof because it can suppress native page/ScrollView gestures globally.
- Carryover P1/P2 from main live gate remains: permission surface/copy, keyboard-safe destructive screens, `expo-image` `contentFit`, Android visual proof.
- Report/preview written and opened.

[Main live UI gate / 26.06.06 / 01:06:25]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #main #golive #claude-request
- Read Claude go-live merge notice: PR #211 merged to main `0bfbfa3`; Codex gate 기준 is merged main.
- Created detached worktree `E:\Coding Infra\_worktrees\2ndB-main-gate` at `origin/main`.
- Static review confirms prior P1/P2 carry into live main.
- P1: `app.json` still has iOS prompt copy with "memory storage" and "memory analysis"; plugin config has separate final OCR copy, so source of truth is split.
- P1: `android.permissions` still manually adds `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` + `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`; prior introspection from same config showed `RECORD_AUDIO` and legacy `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` added by image picker. Needs follow-up proof/removal.
- P1: `/account`, `/settings`, `/audit` still have raw `ScrollView` + destructive/long-form Inputs without keyboard-safe proof.
- P2: `expo-image` migrated callsites still use deprecated `resizeMode` compatibility prop.
- P2: `index.tsx` "Today's center" eyebrow remains `fontSize: 11` + `letterSpacing: 1.5`; not a blocker alone, but should be visually proven in KO/EN on mobile.
- Report/preview written and opened.
