# Codex STATUS

## Current (latest)

- **Task**: screen-reader locale and hidden accessibility-copy audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after the native permission trust gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: source scan found 55 `accessibilityLabel=` hits. Many are localized, but shared components still hard-code hidden labels: `BackArrow` reads locale but announces `"Back"` globally; `LoadingScreen` and `InlineLoader` default to Korean labels; `PremiumBottomSheet` backdrop close is Korean-only; `graph-bits` builds count/context/clear labels with Korean-only copy and exposes `CharacterBadge` as `meta.name.ko`. `InlineLoader` is used without a message in root/index/Jarvis/OAuth callback; `ContextPill` is used in Jarvis.
- **Risk**: screenshots can pass while VoiceOver/TalkBack users hear mixed-language product chrome. This breaks the bilingual UI contract on login/root loading/graph/chat/settings-adjacent flows and is hidden accessibility slop.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 assistive-locale contract gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-070353-to-claude-screenreader-locale-contract-gate.md`

#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #accessibility #i18n #screenreader #locale
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the native permission trust gate.
- Audited hidden accessibility labels across shared UI, loaders, graph/chat bits, and global back chrome.
- Sent Claude a P2 gate: define shared screen-reader copy, localize hard-coded labels, and add KO/EN hidden-label parity proof.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until assistive-language surfaces are consistent and re-gated.

## Previous (native permission trust gate)

- **Task**: native permission localization and trust-copy audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect. User also asked to use SimonK-stack design/anti-slop criteria as reference.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after the wide-web content-measure gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `app.json` owns iOS and `expo-image-picker` camera/photo rationale strings, but they are English-only. Android generated resources contain only base `values/strings.xml`; no `values-ko` resource directory was found. `AndroidManifest.xml` declares `RECORD_AUDIO`, `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`, and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` while `/permissions` says Microphone is not requested and frames camera/photo as optional OCR only. `capture-image.ts` throws `camera_permission_denied`, but `capture.tsx` collapses it into a generic image-open failure alert.
- **Risk**: users and store reviewers see an app that says permissions are transparent, but native prompts/manifests/denial flows do not tell the same story. This is trust-boundary AI slop, not a visual preference.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P1/P2 native permission trust gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-065817-to-claude-native-permission-trust-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-065817-native-permission-trust-gate.html`

#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #permissions #privacy #i18n #android #ios
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the wide-web content-measure gate.
- Consulted SimonK-stack design-review / anti-slop criteria and applied it to OS permission trust surfaces.
- Audited app permission copy, Expo permission strings, Android manifest/resources, and camera denial handling.
- Sent Claude a P1/P2 gate: align native declarations with `/permissions`, localize app-owned permission prompts, split denied-state recovery, and add a permission-ledger guard.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until permission trust surfaces are consistent and re-gated.

## Previous (wide web content measure gate)

- **Task**: wide desktop/web content measure and layout-lane audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after the system-chrome theme gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `app.json` declares static Expo Web output. `PremiumAppShell` supplies padding/safe-area/tabbar clearance but no `maxWidth` or centered desktop lane. Static scan found only 16 `maxWidth` hits across app/components, mostly modals/actions/bubbles. Of 29 files with a `scroll` style, 25 had no `maxWidth` anywhere. Examples include sign-in, sign-up, manual, settings, wiki, account, capture, privacy, and support.
- **Risk**: the app can pass mobile screenshots while reading like a stretched mobile app on 1440px/1920px web. Reading-heavy, trust, auth, settings, and list screens need an intentional desktop measure, not edge-to-edge card stacks.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 desktop/web layout proof gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-065216-to-claude-wide-web-content-measure-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-065216-wide-web-content-measure-gate.html`

[wide web content measure gate / 26.06.06 / 06:52:16]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #web #desktop #responsive #layout
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the system-chrome theme gate.
- Audited PremiumAppShell, route scroll styles, maxWidth usage, and major reading/form/list screens for desktop layout measure.
- Sent Claude a P2 gate: define shared desktop content lanes or explicit route exceptions and prove key screens at 1440px/1920px.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until wide-web composition is governed and re-gated.

## Previous (system chrome theme gate)

- **Task**: native/web system chrome, status bar, and theme-edge audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after the keyboard-safe form gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `_layout.tsx` has one global StatusBar policy based only on `mode`. `PremiumAppShell` wraps content in `ForceDark`, sets a `cosmic.space950` root, and is used 66 times in app routes. Theme docs/code explicitly say the main graph stays dark in light mode. `app.json` uses `userInterfaceStyle: automatic`, Android translucent status bar, and static dark web `themeColor/backgroundColor`. No route-aware SystemUI/NavigationBar/web theme-color sync was found in source.
- **Risk**: the app surface can be dark-forced while OS/browser chrome follows global light mode or static metadata. This can produce dark icons on a dark top edge, mismatched Android navigation strips, or PWA/browser chrome that contradicts the active screen.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 system-chrome polish/proof gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-064831-to-claude-system-chrome-theme-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-064831-system-chrome-theme-gate.html`

[system chrome theme gate / 26.06.06 / 06:48:31]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #statusbar #android #web #pwa #theme
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the keyboard-safe form gate.
- Audited StatusBar, ForceDark/PremiumAppShell, theme toggle, graph dark-mode contract, Android/web chrome config, and metadata.
- Sent Claude a P2 gate: derive native/web system chrome from actual route surface, define Android navigation/system bar behavior, and screenshot dark-forced plus light-secondary states.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until OS/browser edge states are proven.

## Previous (keyboard safe form contract gate)

- **Task**: keyboard-safe form and mobile input-overlap audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after the design-token drift gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `useKeyboard()` exists and sign-in/sign-up/capture/import/formats already use `KeyboardAvoidingView`, Android keyboard-height padding, or `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`. Static scan found input files without the same contract: `account.tsx`, `settings.tsx`, `audit.tsx`, `components/wiki/TemplateEditor.tsx`, and reusable `BirthDateField.tsx`. `PremiumAppShell` handles safe-area/tabbar clearance but explicitly leaves ScrollView/layout to screens.
- **Risk**: static screenshots can look polished while keyboard-open states hide validation copy, final CTAs, or destructive confirmation buttons on mobile. This remains a 100-point proof gap for login-to-settings coverage.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 mobile form ergonomics/proof gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-064312-to-claude-keyboard-safe-form-contract-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-064312-keyboard-safe-form-contract-gate.html`

[keyboard safe form contract gate / 26.06.06 / 06:43:12]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #mobile #keyboard #forms #screenshots
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the design-token drift gate.
- Audited input-heavy screens for keyboard avoidance, Android padding, tap handling, and shared shell coverage.
- Sent Claude a P2 gate: introduce/shared-enforce a keyboard-safe form contract, apply it to account/settings/audit/wiki editor, and screenshot keyboard-open states.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until keyboard-open mobile form states are proven.

## Previous (design token contract drift gate)

- **Task**: design-token contract drift audit using SimonK-stack design/anti-slop criteria.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect. User also asked to reference SimonK-stack design skills and prevent AI slop.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after the document-language/input-assist gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `DESIGN.md` forbids component hex literals, gradients, unapproved overlays, off-scale spacing, pill chips, and dark-surface drop shadows. `tokens.ts` provides `withAlpha()` specifically to avoid hard-coded `rgba()`. Static scan excluding pixel art found 74 raw color literal candidates, 43 raw radius candidates, and 208 shadow/elevation hits in `src/app` and `src/components`. `package.json` has no design-contract guard in `verify`.
- **Risk**: the app can keep the Cosmic Pixel identity in docs while implementation slowly drifts back into generic AI UI: raw purple/mint glass overlays, repeated glow recipes, and pill/circle chrome without an exception ledger.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 design-system governance gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-063903-to-claude-design-token-contract-drift-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-063903-design-token-contract-drift-gate.html`

[design token contract drift gate / 26.06.06 / 06:39:03]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #design-system #tokens #simonkstack
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the document language/input assistance gate.
- Read SimonK-stack design/anti-slop skill guidance and applied it to the app's executable design contract.
- Sent Claude a P2 gate: replace or ledger raw component visual values, define radius/shadow exceptions, and add a design-contract check to `verify`.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until design-token drift is guarded and re-gated.

## Previous (document language input assistance gate)

- **Task**: document language and browser/mobile input assistance audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after the visual QA automation gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `src/app/+html.tsx:44` hard-codes `<html lang="ko">` while app routes and auth/manual language toggles can render English. `i18n/index.ts` persists `languageChanged`, but source scan found no `document.documentElement.lang` sync. Static input scan across `src/app` and `src/components` found `TextInput=12`, `<Input=26`, `autoComplete=4`, `textContentType=0`, `keyboardType=3`, `returnKeyType=3`. Auth email/password fields have useful hints, but consent birth date and destructive confirmation fields lack a fuller field-purpose contract.
- **Risk**: the UI can look localized while the browser, screen reader, spellcheck, translation, and autofill semantics remain wrong or generic. This is semantic AI slop, especially on English web and high-risk consent/account/settings forms.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P1 document-language gate plus P2 input-assistance gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-063518-to-claude-document-lang-input-assist-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-063518-document-lang-input-assist-gate.html`

[document language input assistance gate / 26.06.06 / 06:35:18]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #i18n #accessibility #forms #autofill
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the visual QA automation gate.
- Audited web root language metadata, i18n language persistence, and input-purpose hints across app/components.
- Sent Claude a P1/P2 gate: sync document language with KO/EN, define high-risk field input contracts, and add regression proof.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until document-language and input-assistance proof is re-gated.

## Previous (visual QA automation gate)

- **Task**: visual QA automation and screenshot-proof infrastructure audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after pixel font readability gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `package.json` `verify` covers static checks and Jest only. No Playwright/Detox/Cypress/Storybook/axe/visual regression tooling or scripts are present. CI runs static/unit checks only; web deploy builds and publishes but does not run route/asset/focus smoke. Existing age/persona UI simulation explicitly covered only sign-in, sign-up, and not-found, not authenticated traversal. HANDOFF recommends `/qa` and `/design-review` because browse-dependent checks were not run in that environment.
- **Risk**: the team cannot reproducibly prove the many open UI gates: zoom/focus, text clipping, safe-area overlap, modal focus, route states, graph nonblank rendering, and mobile/desktop screenshots. Static review cannot certify 100/100.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P1 proof-infrastructure gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-062944-to-claude-visual-qa-automation-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-062944-visual-qa-automation-gate.html`

[visual QA automation gate / 26.06.06 / 06:29:44]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #visual-qa #screenshots #ci #proof
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the pixel font readability gate.
- Audited package scripts, CI, web deploy, docs/ux prior QA scope, and HANDOFF notes.
- Sent Claude a P1 gate: add a repeatable visual/browser QA harness, route/state screenshot matrix, post-build/deploy smoke, and artifact index for re-gating.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until visual QA automation proof is available and run.

## Previous (pixel font readability gate)

- **Task**: pixel font and long-form readability contract audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after web zoom/focus gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `typography.ts` explicitly says long Korean paragraphs/bottom-sheet descriptions/CTAs should not use the pixel face because it hurts legibility, but `fontFamilies.sans` still maps to `PIXEL` and shared `Text` uses `fontFamilies.sans` for all variants. `fontFamilies.readable` exists but source scan found only 2 uses, versus 98 `variant="body"` occurrences. Web root also forces `button`, `input`, `textarea`, and `select` into NeoDunggeunmo/monospace.
- **Risk**: the app can look branded while legal/privacy/help/settings/generated text becomes slower to read, especially in Korean, small sizes, dark surfaces, and long private text inputs.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 typography/readability gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-062728-to-claude-pixel-font-readability-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-062728-pixel-font-readability-gate.html`

[pixel font readability gate / 26.06.06 / 06:27:28]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #typography #readability #pixel-font #korean
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the web zoom/focus gate.
- Audited typography contracts, shared Text, web font override, and long-form body-copy usage.
- Sent Claude a P2 gate: define pixel vs readable font rules, migrate legal/help/settings/generated body copy to readable sans, and prove narrow/zoom readability.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until typography/readability proof is re-gated.

## Previous (web zoom focus gate)

- **Task**: web zoom and keyboard focus-visible accessibility audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after dynamic type clipping gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `src/app/+html.tsx` globally sets `maximum-scale=1`, `minimum-scale=1`, and `user-scalable=no`, with `overflow:hidden` and document-level `touch-action: pan-x pan-y`. Static scan found 109 `Pressable` usages in app/components, effectively one `onFocus` usage in `Input`, and no shared focus-visible token/style for PremiumButton/tabbar/BackArrow/links/chips/graph controls/row actions. `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` is also globally hidden.
- **Risk**: web users cannot use browser zoom, and keyboard users may not receive visible focus feedback across the premium Pressable-based UI. This is a direct accessibility blocker before any 100/100 claim.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P1 web accessibility gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-062410-to-claude-web-zoom-focus-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-062410-web-zoom-focus-gate.html`

[web zoom focus gate / 26.06.06 / 06:24:10]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #web #accessibility #zoom #keyboard #focus-visible
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the dynamic type clipping gate.
- Audited web root viewport/CSS and shared Pressable focus patterns.
- Sent Claude a P1 gate: remove global browser zoom lock, scope graph gesture constraints, add focus-visible styling for shared controls, and prove keyboard-only walkthroughs.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until web zoom/focus proof is re-gated.

## Previous (dynamic type clipping gate)

- **Task**: dynamic type, text clipping, and touch-target proof audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after bottom overlay safe-area gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: no global `allowFontScaling={false}` pattern found, which is good. But static scan across `src/app` and `src/components` found 22 `numberOfLines={1}`, 10 `numberOfLines={2}`, 12 font-size 9/10/11 hits, and 9 sub-44 min-height hits. Notable proof targets: BackArrow one-line 220px route label, 11px tab labels, NavGraph village tags, DrillProgress 11px labels, capture saved-title clamp, TemplateEditor format-name clamp, and Jarvis 36px mode chips/tabs.
- **Risk**: the app may look polished at default text size while clipping navigation labels, graph labels, user-generated names, and progress aids under large text or narrow-phone conditions.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 dynamic-type/text-clipping proof gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-062116-to-claude-dynamic-type-clipping-gate.md`

#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #accessibility #dynamic-type #text-clipping #touch-target
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the bottom overlay safe-area gate.
- Scanned text clamps, micro text, and sub-44px control heights across app/components.
- Sent Claude a P2 gate: prove KO/EN large-text and 320px layouts, create line-clamp and touch-target ledgers, and fix any navigation/user-generated/progress labels that clip.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until dynamic-type proof is re-gated.

## Previous (bottom overlay safe-area gate)

- **Task**: bottom overlay, tabbar, and safe-area overlap audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after i18n/copy contract gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `PremiumAppShell` correctly reserves tabbar clearance for normal content and `PremiumTabBar` uses safe-area insets. But `PremiumBottomSheet` is exported with absolute fill/flex-end placement and no safe-area/tabbar context; `formats.tsx` toast wrapper uses `bottom: spacing.xl`; tab-route companion moments use route-local absolute bottoms (`capture` 40, `jarvis` 90); Jarvis reference drawer is a modal sheet with `bottom: 0`.
- **Risk**: polished bottom details can overlap the tab bar, home indicator, keyboard/composer, or browser bottom chrome on narrow/mobile screens. Without screenshots, this remains a 100-point proof gap.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 runtime proof/safe-area gate before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:

#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #safe-area #tabbar #overlay #mobile
- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the i18n/copy contract gate.
- Audited PremiumAppShell, PremiumTabBar, PremiumBottomSheet, PremiumToast placement, tab-route companion moments, and Jarvis reference drawer.
- Sent Claude a P2 gate: add shared bottom overlay clearance or screenshot-proof every route-local absolute bottom UI against tabbar/safe-area/keyboard overlap.
- Score remains 98/100 provisional until bottom overlay proof is re-gated.

## Previous (i18n copy contract gate)

- **Task**: i18n and user-facing copy source-of-truth audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after feedback Alert contract gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: locale bundles currently have 9 namespaces and 204 leaf values per locale, but a static source scan found 915 locale-branch hits across `src/app`, `src/components`, and `src/lib`. Hotspots include `capture.tsx` 99, `settings.tsx` 75, `wiki.tsx` 58, `formats.tsx` 50, `persona.tsx` 40, `inbox.tsx` 37, and wiki template editors. `check:i18n` proves bundle key parity only; no hardcoded-copy scanner proves all visible screen copy is catalogued/reviewed.
- **Risk**: UI copy can look localized while legal, safety, destructive, and AI-result strings remain outside a single reviewable source of truth. That weakens screenshot QA, copy review, and typography-rule enforcement before 100.

- Confirmed no new Claude app implementation after the feedback Alert contract gate.
- Scanned source/locales and found a split copy system: 9 locale namespaces with 204 keys per locale, but 915 locale-branch hits in app/component/lib source.

## Previous (feedback alert contract gate)

- **Task**: feedback, Alert, Toast, and error/success surface contract audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after consent legal-readiness gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `src/app` still contains 61 `Alert.alert` callsites. `formats.tsx` proves a better local pattern with `PremiumToast`/`PremiumModal`, but that feedback system is not generalized. Single-argument alerts remain in auth, inbox, and wiki. Inbox shows long generated summary/questions in native Alert. Settings uses native Alert for many destructive success/failure flows.
- **Risk**: premium dark UI can fall back to platform/browser-default alert chrome for core product feedback, and generated content can appear in cramped transient modals instead of a reviewable app surface.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 all-screen feedback-contract gate before 100, with P1 potential if public web still exposes browser alerts.

## Previous (consent legal-readiness gate)

- **Task**: consent, privacy, and legal-readiness trust UI audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop; repeat Claude review until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after contrast ledger gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `ConsentNotice` is live in sign-up/complete-profile while its own header says copy is placeholder pending legal review and `LEXICON_LAST_LEGAL_REVIEW` is null. `consent.ts` hard-codes consent/privacy/terms versions while TODO says they must track published policy/terms and re-consent. `recordConsentBestEffort()` can fail while auth/profile flow continues. Testimonial `ConsentDialog` defaults judge sharing to ON. Privacy `Switch` rows lack explicit switch labels/disabled reasons.
- **Risk**: the UI can look polished while the privacy contract remains unfinished, silent on ledger failure, or defaults outward sharing too aggressively. That is trust-surface AI slop and blocks a true 100/100 score.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P1 trust/legal-readiness gate before 100.

## Previous (contrast ledger gate)

- **Task**: color contrast ledger and light palette audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after form input gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: calculated dark semantic text/button pairs mostly pass AA. But `semanticLight.textSubtle` reaches only 4.18:1 on light bg and 3.89:1 on light surface; `semanticLight.warning` reaches 4.35:1 on light bg; `lightCosmic.test.ts` checks shape/family but not contrast; `sign-in.tsx` disabled CTA applies whole-control opacity 0.4 and blends to about 3.04:1.
- **Risk**: Light mode cannot be made real without contrast regressions, and the current pre-auth disabled submit state is weakly legible. A 100/100 claim needs a contrast ledger, not only visual inspection.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 contrast-proof/theme gate before 100.

## Previous (form input a11y gate)

- **Task**: form input accessibility and validation semantics audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop.

- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after modal overlay gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: good patterns exist in records/wiki/jarvis/import labelled inputs, consent checkbox role/state, and PremiumButton role/state. But shared `Input`, `PremiumInput`, and `PremiumTextarea` lack label/helper/error/invalid contract; auth fields, birth date, account/settings destructive confirmation inputs, capture/audit/interview text areas, AddFormatFlow, and TemplateEditor fields rely heavily on placeholders or nearby text. Validation errors are not consistently alert/live-region/focusable.
- **Risk**: forms can look complete while screen-reader and keyboard users do not receive field names, invalid state, required/optional meaning, or reasons why submit/danger buttons are disabled.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 form accessibility gate before 100.

## Previous (modal overlay a11y gate)

- **Task**: modal, drawer, and overlay accessibility audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after reduced-motion gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: `CrisisRouter` is a good modal pattern with `accessibilityViewIsModal`, alert role, label, and button hint. But `PremiumModal` at `feedback.tsx:66-71` lacks title/role contract and affects `formats.tsx:436-478`; `QuantIntroModal.tsx:95-102` and `ConsentDialog.tsx:38-43` lack modal card semantics; `QuantIntroModal.tsx:139-143` custom checkbox lacks checkbox role/state; `jarvis.tsx:483-546`, `core-brain.tsx:294-306`, and `NavGraph.tsx:1659/:1737` have inconsistent drawer/sheet label, role, close, and row-action semantics.
- **Risk**: visual overlays can look polished while assistive tech still traverses the underlying screen or sees unlabeled cards, roleless close controls, and state-less custom checkboxes. Consent/backdrop dismissal is also weaker than the safety modal standard.

## Previous (reduced motion gate)

- **Task**: reduced-motion and sensory-load audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after image accessibility semantics gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: good reduced-motion precedents exist in `SceneHero`, `Jarvis`, `QuantSaveCelebration`, and `LivingAsset`. But the shared helper in `src/lib/motion/signature.ts:82-92` intentionally returns `false` when `matchMedia` is unavailable, and `signature.test.ts:37-42` locks that native behavior in. `LoadingScreen.tsx:134`, `:180-185`, and `:207-214` run typewriter, heartbeat, and 4x zoom without reduced-motion checks. `NavGraph.tsx:746` and `:1061-1074` still run ambient drift/pulse loops.
- **Risk**: iOS/Android users with OS Reduce Motion enabled still get major animated entry and graph motion. This is a high-visibility accessibility gap for a motion-heavy app.

## Previous (image a11y semantics gate)

- **Task**: image/art accessibility semantics audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after pre-auth recovery gate; latest Claude outbox remains `20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: good decorative-art hiding patterns exist in `LivingAsset`, `IslandArt`, `TierIcon`, `WikiCardThumb`, `SecondBSprite`, and `CompanionSprite`. But auth hero images at `sign-in.tsx:167`, `sign-up.tsx:196`, and `complete-profile.tsx:136` are not explicitly hidden; OCR selected image preview at `capture.tsx:973` has no content-image label/role; NavGraph image hit areas at `NavGraph.tsx:1409`, `:1478`, and `:1522` have labels but no button role; `index.tsx:411` adds a static "SecondB" accessibility label around an otherwise decorative sprite.
- **Risk**: visuals can look finished while assistive technology receives noisy decoration, unlabeled user content, or labelled-but-roleless image buttons. This is a semantic AI-slop residue before 100/100.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 accessibility/product-polish gate before 100.

## Previous (preauth recovery dead-end gate)

- **Task**: pre-auth account/password recovery dead-end audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after theme contract gate.
- **Evidence**: `sign-in.tsx` forgot-password handler only shows an alert containing `support@2nd-brain.app`; no Supabase reset helper exists in `lib/supabase/auth.ts`; `/support` has the actual mailto button but redirects unauthenticated users to `/sign-in`; OAuth callback failure only returns to sign-in.
- **Risk**: locked-out users see a recovery affordance but no working recovery action. This is high-trust surface failure for an app storing private self-knowledge.

## Previous (theme contract slop gate)

- **Task**: theme contract and Light mode audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after route IA gate.
- **Evidence**: `/theme` offers Dark/Light and describes Light as a bright paper tone; `/settings` repeats a quick Dark/Light toggle. But `PremiumAppShell` wraps children in `ForceDark`, `useThemePalette()` returns dark tokens under force-dark, and most signed-in routes/components either live under PremiumAppShell or import static dark `semantic` tokens. `_layout.tsx` also flips status bar style by theme mode, which can make Light mode use dark status bar icons over a dark forced shell.
- **Risk**: the theme selector can feel fake: state changes and the active pill moves, but most signed-in pages remain dark. Possible status-bar contrast issue needs device proof.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 product-polish/trust blocker, possible P1 if status-bar contrast is confirmed.

## Previous (route IA numbering slop gate)

- **Task**: route IA, duplicate hub, and visible numbering audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after Codex state-affordance gate.
- **Evidence**: primary tab IA is four tabs (`Graph`, `Capture`, `SecondB`, `Me`). `/profile` renders 20 same-weight destination chips. `/settings` repeats Profile/Data links, and `/data` routes delete back to Settings. Many `SceneHero` eyebrows expose numeric route order (`01`, `08-1`, `11`). Route labels drift (`/audit`: Profile "Past me" vs BackArrow "Audit"/KO "감사"; `/persona`: Persona vs Self model; `/trinity`: Trinity vs 4-area management).
- **Risk**: users see an internal route map instead of a designed hierarchy. This is IA-level AI slop: every generated screen is reachable, but priority, naming, and ownership are not coherent.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 IA/product-polish blocker before 100.

## Previous (state affordance slop gate)

- **Task**: spinner-only and placeholder empty-state audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI issue discovery/improvement toward 100/100 anti-slop.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after `agents/claude/outbox/20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Evidence**: good state patterns already exist in `PremiumLoadingState`/`PremiumEmptyState`/`PremiumErrorState`, `core-brain`, `formats`, and `persona`. But `profile`, `audit`, `record/[id]`, `records`, `insights`, `inbox`, `wiki`, `research`, and `trinity` still include spinner-only loading states or placeholder/raw-taxonomy empty copy.
- **Risk**: slow network, direct deep link, first-run empty data, and list refresh states feel unfinished or ambiguous. This is a common AI-slop residue: polished happy path, generic intermediate states.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 polish/trust blocker before 100.

## Previous (runtime proof matrix gate)

- **Task**: 100-point runtime proof matrix gate.
- **src**: user `/goal` - AI slop score should aim for 100/100; review Claude's related completions repeatedly until perfect.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Claude state**: no newer Claude implementation after `agents/claude/outbox/20260606-045614-to-all-cycle5-live-loopend-final.md`.
- **Grok/design references**: Grok trust-copy gate emphasizes sovereignty, source boundaries, agency, and humility. SimonK-stack `design-review` and `ai-slop-cleaner` criteria require screenshot-backed visual QA and anti-slop checks for hierarchy, Korean readability, missing states, generic visual defaults, and weak proof.
- **Finding**: 100/100 cannot be certified from static review + `npm run verify` alone. The app has 30+ route files and many stateful surfaces from pre-auth to settings; current open gates require actual viewport/keyboard/state proof.
- **Risk**: text clipping, hidden CTAs, keyboard-covered destructive forms, implementation vocabulary, route dead ends, and Pressable state gaps can survive automated tests.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a final proof blocker before 100.

## Previous (destructive delete friction gate)

- **Task**: settings destructive delete friction audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI anti-slop review toward 100/100.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Evidence**: `account` has a stronger terminal delete pattern (`DELETE` typed confirmation + no retry after partial account-delete failure). `settings` uses one generic `confirm()` for many broad delete/reset actions and offers retry on failed full wipe even though `deleteAllUserData` is multi-step.
- **Risk**: high-density danger zone can make broad partial delete actions feel too easy and too similar. Failure copy does not expose which parts may already be gone.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 data-loss trust blocker before 100.

- **Task**: user-facing internal vocabulary sweep across permissions/inbox/wiki/settings/insights.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI anti-slop review toward 100/100.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Evidence**: public/manual jargon already reported, but additional signed-in surfaces still expose implementation terms: Supabase/Gemini/RLS in permissions, metadata/frontmatter keys in inbox, `[[slug]]`/dangling link in generated alerts, `slug` search placeholder, `[[wikilink]] edges`, raw model marker in wiki source brief, and "without an LLM call" in insights.
- **Risk**: these labels make core data/privacy surfaces feel like implementation scaffolding rather than a designed consumer product.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 product-language/trust blocker before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-050811-to-claude-user-language-internal-terms-gate.md`

[user-language internal terms gate / 26.06.06 / 05:08:11]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #copy #trust #language
- Scanned user-facing strings for implementation vocabulary beyond the manual.
- Found internal terms still visible on permissions, inbox, wiki, settings, and insights.
- Sent Claude P2 gate: translate implementation terms to user concepts, keep technical details in developer docs/logs, and verify via string grep + screenshots.

## Previous (pressable semantics gate)

- **Task**: high-density custom `Pressable` semantics audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI anti-slop review toward 100/100.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Evidence**: good local patterns exist in `settings` custom buttons, `formats` schema/delete actions, and `jarvis` mode chips. Several adjacent custom `Pressable` controls in inbox/wiki/research/capture/core-brain/manual lack consistent `accessibilityRole`, `accessibilityLabel`, and/or `accessibilityState`.
- **Risk**: high-density lists and chips look interactive but expose weak semantics to assistive tech; selected/expanded/disabled/destructive states are not reliably announced.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 accessibility/interactability blocker before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-050427-to-claude-pressable-semantics-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-050427-pressable-semantics-gate.html`

[pressable semantics gate / 26.06.06 / 05:04:27]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #a11y #pressable #semantics
- Compared good custom control semantics in settings/formats/jarvis against dense list/chip surfaces.
- Found missing role/label/state on inbox rows/actions, wiki export/tag/page actions, research filters/links, capture toggles/tags, core-brain drawer rows, manual language toggle, and jarvis clear chat.
- Sent Claude P2 gate with acceptance criteria: all custom Pressables need role, user-readable label, selected/expanded/disabled state where relevant, and title-specific destructive labels.

## Previous (keyboard-safe danger forms gate)

- **Task**: account/settings/audit keyboard-safe form shell audit.
- **src**: user `/goal` - continue all-screen UI anti-slop review toward 100/100.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Evidence**: `sign-in`, `sign-up`, `complete-profile`, `formats`, `import`, and `capture` already use `KeyboardAvoidingView` + `keyboardShouldPersistTaps` + `useKeyboard`. `account`, `settings`, and `audit` have user input fields inside plain `ScrollView`.
- **Risk**: settings/account include bottom-of-screen destructive confirmation inputs. On mobile, the keyboard can cover the confirm input or the destructive CTA, making a data-loss flow feel brittle.
- **Score**: still **98/100 provisional**. This is a P2 interaction polish/trust blocker before 100.
- **Latest outputs**:
  - `agents/codex/outbox/20260606-050210-to-claude-keyboard-safe-danger-forms-gate.md`
  - `agents/codex/outbox/preview/20260606-050210-keyboard-safe-danger-forms-gate.html`

[keyboard-safe danger forms gate / 26.06.06 / 05:02:10]
#comm #codex #user #2nd-B #ui-ux #ai-slop #goal #keyboard #forms #settings #account #audit
- Compared existing good pattern: useKeyboard + KeyboardAvoidingView + keyboardShouldPersistTaps in auth/capture/import/formats.
- Found missing shell on account/settings/audit despite DOB/delete/audit textarea inputs.
- Sent Claude P2 gate: apply the same keyboard-safe shell pattern and prove it with mobile screenshots or focused runtime check.

## Previous (main 911c979 privacy re-gate)

- **Task**: main `911c979` privacy monotonicity merge re-gate.
- **src**: user `/goal` - keep reviewing Claude's completed UI/privacy work until 100/100 anti-slop.
- **App baseline**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `911c979`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **Verification**:
  - `npm test -- --ci src/lib/privacy/__tests__/analytics-consent-queue.test.ts`: PASS, 4/4.
  - `npm run verify`: PASS; lint/type/i18n/lexicon/LLM-boundary/constraints/emdash + Jest 92 suites / 830 tests.
- **Verdict**: cycle-5 privacy P1 is accepted on live main. The stale completion and failed opt-out revert paths are both covered.
- **Score**: live main is **98/100 provisional**, not 100. Remaining anti-slop gates: pre-auth manual trust, support access/export-copy, keyboard-safe forms, destructive partial-delete friction, Pressable semantics, and runtime screenshot proof.
- **Latest outputs**:

- Detected merged main `911c979 fix(privacy): external-analytics opt-out is monotonic across queued saves (#215)`.
- Ran targeted privacy queue test: PASS, including failed opt-out revert case.
- Ran full `npm run verify`: PASS, 92 suites / 830 tests.
- Accepted privacy P1 on live main; continued to hold overall score below 100 because non-privacy UX/trust gates remain open.

## Previous (pre-auth manual trust gate)

- **작업**: pre-auth manual/first-run trust UX 추가 감사.
- **src**: user `/goal` - 모든 화면 UI 문제를 100/100까지 계속 탐색/보고.
- **앱 기준**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `claude/cycle-5-privacy-monotonicity`, head `12bc27d`, clean.
- **새 발견**: 로그인/가입 화면은 pre-auth 사용자를 `/manual`로 보냄. manual은 public 렌더 가능하지만 첫인상 화면에 `RLS`, `auth.uid()`, `RAG`, `system context`, `LLM`, raw route names, `[[wikilink]]` 등을 노출. 또한 manual의 "Curated research" CTA는 `/research`로 가지만 `/research`는 unauthenticated user를 `/sign-in`으로 redirect.
- **추가 a11y**: `sign-in.tsx:286-290` forgot-password custom `Pressable`에 role/label 없음.
- **점수**: privacy는 branch 기준 accepted이나, 전체 100점은 아직 아님. pre-auth front door 신뢰 UX가 새 P2 blocker.

- Confirmed `/manual` is used from sign-in/sign-up as a pre-auth first-run guide.
- Found internal vocabulary in first-run manual: RLS, auth.uid(), RAG, system context, LLM, raw routes, wikilink syntax.
- Found public-to-private trap: manual links to `/research`, but `/research` redirects unauthenticated users back to sign-in.
- Added forgot-password Pressable semantics as related recovery-path a11y gap.
- Sent Claude high-priority P2 trust gate with acceptance criteria and HTML preview.

## Previous (12bc27d privacy re-gate)

- **작업**: Claude `12bc27d` privacy opt-out monotonicity clean re-gate 완료.
- **src**: user `/goal` - 모든 화면 UI 문제를 100/100까지 계속 탐색/보고.
- **앱 기준**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `claude/cycle-5-privacy-monotonicity`, head `12bc27d`, clean and aligned with `origin/claude/cycle-5-privacy-monotonicity`.
- **검증**: failed opt-out inline probe `applied: [false]`; `npm run verify` PASS (92 suites / 830 tests). `node_modules/.bin`이 일부 사라져 있어 `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`로 로컬 deps를 복구한 뒤 재검증했고 git worktree는 clean 유지.
- **판정**: privacy P1은 이 브랜치 기준 accepted. stale successful completion과 failed opt-out revert path 모두 닫힘.
- **점수**: branch score **98/100 provisional**. main merge 전까지 live 기준은 별도 re-gate 필요. 전체 100점은 아직 아님: keyboard-safe shells, destructive partial-delete friction, Pressable semantics, internal vocabulary, support access/export-copy, runtime screenshot proof 남음.

## Previous (privacy WIP preaccept + support gate)

- **작업**: Claude privacy fail-closed WIP read-only preflight + 설정 인접 화면 추가 trust UX gate.
- **src**: user `/goal` - 모든 화면 UI 문제를 100/100까지 계속 탐색/보고.
- **앱 기준**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `claude/cycle-5-privacy-monotonicity`, head `0fe8be5`, dirty WIP: `src/lib/privacy/analytics-consent-queue.ts`, `src/lib/privacy/__tests__/analytics-consent-queue.test.ts`.
- **privacy WIP 판정**: failed opt-out 재현이 `[false,true]`에서 `[false]`로 개선. targeted queue test PASS(4 tests), inline failed opt-out probe PASS, `npm run type-check` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS, `npm run verify` PASS(92 suites / 830 tests). 커밋/푸시 후 clean re-gate되면 P1 privacy blocker를 닫을 수 있는 상태.
- **새 UI gate**: `/support`가 auth-gated라 로그인 실패/비밀번호 문제 사용자가 지원 화면을 못 여는 support dead-end. `support.tsx:42`는 "Export in Settings"라고 안내하지만 실제 export는 `/data` -> `/wiki`/store 쪽.
- **점수**: privacy WIP는 pre-accept. 전체 점수는 아직 **97/100 provisional** 유지. privacy 커밋 후에는 상승 가능하지만 keyboard/destructive/Pressable/jargon/runtime proof/support access가 남음.

- Continued settings-adjacent all-screen audit and sent new P2 trust gate: `/support` is auth-gated and Support FAQ points export to Settings while actual export is wiki/store.

## Previous (0fe8be5 privacy re-gate)

- **작업**: Claude `0fe8be5` privacy monotonicity patch re-gate.
- **src**: user `/goal` - 100/100 anti-slop까지 Claude 완료분을 반복 리뷰.
- **앱 기준**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `claude/cycle-5-privacy-monotonicity`, head `0fe8be5`, clean and aligned with `origin/claude/cycle-5-privacy-monotonicity`.
- **검증**: `npm run verify` PASS (92 suites / 829 tests). 추가 inline simulation도 실행.
- **판정**: stale successful completion이 다시 analytics를 켜는 원래 문제는 구조적으로 닫히는 방향. 하지만 failed opt-out path에서 `applied: [false, true]` 재현. 기존 true 상태에서 off 저장이 실패하면 `onError` revert 후 queue reconcile이 다시 `setAnalyticsConsent(true)`를 호출할 수 있음.
- **요구**: failed external analytics opt-out은 local fail-closed로 유지하고 regression test 추가. UI는 save error/retry를 보여도 local analytics consent는 사용자가 명시적으로 다시 켤 때까지 off.

- **앱 기준**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `main`, head `ee9f80b`, clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- **재확인**: `/privacy` 화면 `src/app/privacy.tsx:91-100`의 queued save가 stale captured payload로 `setAnalyticsConsent(payload.external_analytics)` 호출.
- **테스트 갭**: 기존 tests는 storage prefs/analytics no-op/prefs utility만 커버. `/privacy` screen queue interaction + external analytics opt-out monotonicity는 미검증.
- **재현 결과**: on -> off rapid toggle에서 Save A resolve 후 `analyticsEvents: [true]`, final `[true,false]`. 사용자가 opt-out한 뒤 true가 transient하게 재적용됨.

- **판정**: retired-route gate는 통과했지만, custom Pressable semantics가 앱 전반 패턴 debt. 시각적 버튼/칩/행/링크가 role/label/selected/expanded/disabled/busy state를 충분히 노출하지 않음.
- **정확화**: 단순 카운터는 모달 백드롭/멀티라인 때문에 과검출하므로 보고서에는 직접 확인한 사용자-facing controls만 라인 근거로 포함.
- **인코딩 확인**: PowerShell `Get-Content` 일부 출력은 mojibake처럼 보였으나 `git show` 및 Node UTF-8 검사에서 replacement/triple-question runs 0. 실제 소스 문자열 문제로 보고하지 않음.

- **앱 기준**: `E:\2ndB`, branch `claude/cycle-3-hardening`, head `9b03f04`, clean. 새 Claude 커밋 없음.
- **이번 감사**: settings/account/support/permissions/audit 화면군. 삭제/계정/권한/지원은 신뢰 경로라 100점 기준에서 별도 gate 필요.
- **새 발견**: `settings`, `account`, `audit`가 `ScrollView + Input`인데 `KeyboardAvoidingView`/`keyboardShouldPersistTaps`가 없음. `settings`의 partial delete들은 full wipe와 달리 typed confirmation 없이 generic alert 한 번으로 broad irreversible delete 가능. `permissions`는 user-facing `RLS`를 노출. account delete fallback은 support가 완료해준다는 운영 약속을 함.

- Ran route/input static scan. Found `settings`, `account`, `audit` have `ScrollView + Input` without `KeyboardAvoidingView` and without `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`, unlike fixed sign-in/sign-up/capture/jarvis/interview screens.
- New P1 gate: destructive `DELETE` confirmations in settings/account need keyboard-safe proof/fix; audit multiline answer also needs keyboard-safe behavior.
- New P1/P2 gate: `/settings` partial broad deletes use a generic alert and one destructive button without count preview/export CTA/typed confirmation; `/permissions` exposes RLS; account deletion fallback makes an unproven support completion promise.

- **작업**: Simon 지시 - 모든 화면 UI/UX와 AI slop를 100/100 기준으로 반복 게이트. Claude 완료물은 즉시 재리뷰하고, 100점 전까지 outbox로 의견을 계속 남긴다.
- **src**: user - "AI slop는 점수가 100점 이 되는것을 지향해. 클로드가 관련 작업을 완료하면 리뷰하고 의견주기를 완벽해질때까지 반복해. /goal"
- **최신 Claude 기준**: `agents/claude/outbox/20260606-013358-to-all-cycle2-audit-baseline.md`, committed spec fix `7ee23ce` (Lumi -> Iris), and `agents/claude/outbox/20260606-014743-to-all-cycle2-perf-audit.md` assigning Codex to include perf items in cycle-2 re-gate.
- **검사 기준**: SimonK-stack `simon-design-first`, `design-review`, `design-consultation`, `design-html`를 참고하되 2nd-B 기존 `DESIGN.md` dark premium/village system을 보존. 사용자에게 보이는 mock/stub/placeholder/coming-soon, 권한 불일치, unproven provider, keyboard/list proof gap, source-of-truth split, stale worldview residue를 100점 감점 요인으로 본다.
- **대상 앱 상태**:
  - App worktree `E:\2ndB` branch `claude/cycle-2-concept-consistency`, clean, head `71f44fe` (ahead 2 from `origin/main`).
- **검증**: `npm run verify` pass on `71f44fe`: lint/type-check/i18n/lexicon/constraints/emdash/tests green, 91 suites, 823 tests.
- **현재 점수**: 71f44fe UI re-gate = 88/100 provisional. Placeholder/permission/MBTI/BackArrow fixes are accepted, but 100/100 remains blocked by support FAQ vocabulary policy violation, raw error alerts, user-visible mock-mode strings, unproven social provider affordances, consent/legal launch readiness, assessment tap-target proof, internal "Phase 1" labels, stale worldview residue, keyboard/list proof, and Claude's new perf-gate items (FlatList, NavGraph LOD, background timers, memory prune).

- P1: `/support` still has FAQ placeholder "A help center is on the way."
- P1/P2: Google/Apple/Kakao auth buttons are always visible; Naver is config-gated. Primary auth providers need live proof or config-gated UI.

- Acceptable direction with proof: `<base href="/2nd-B/">` likely aligns GitHub Pages base path, but should be verified with refresh/deep link/static asset loading.
- Capture WIP is mostly no-op/proof-needed: `keyboardVerticalOffset={0}` adds no behavior, `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="never"` needs iOS/capture keyboard screenshot.
- NavGraph WIP is plausible but proof-needed: viewport resize re-clamp and offHome debounce need web/native pan/zoom/reset proof.

- New proof blocker: narrow mobile action rows. `/wiki` utility row is 3-up (`Export`, `Graph detail`, `Back`) with `actionsUtility: flexDirection row` and `actionBtn: flex:1`; 320px approximate button budget is ~90px while `Graph detail` needs ~132px with current PremiumButton padding.
- Additional proof targets: `/capture` saved/proposed-format 2-up rows, `/import` saved actions, `/interview` completion/footer actions, NavGraph sheet actions, and auth hero rows in `/sign-up` + `/complete-profile`.
- Requested responsive primitive or KO/EN 320px/Pixel screenshots. Score remains 97/100 provisional, not 100.

- Continued all-screen route-shell audit on app HEAD `d8ba4a0`; dirty Claude cycle-3 WIP ignored for scoring.
- Static route scan found 36 route paths. Missing BackArrow labels among non-hidden routes: `/+not-found`, `/imagine`, `/journal`, `/oauth-callback`.
- New P1/P2 gate: `/oauth-callback` is an auth handoff route but not in `PRE_AUTH_PATHS`, so global BackArrow can render during Naver OAuth loading/failure. BackArrow also always `router.push("/")` while announcing hardcoded English `Back`, which is inaccurate/non-localized and lacks role button.
- Requested hide/proof for OAuth callback, localized action-accurate BackArrow label, and redirect/404 deep-link proof. Score remains 97/100 provisional.
