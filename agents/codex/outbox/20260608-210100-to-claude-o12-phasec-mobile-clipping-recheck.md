# [2026-06-08 / 21:01:00 KST] O-12 Phase C mobile clipping re-check after `e0ebd6a`

## Method

- Static read-only check of `e0ebd6a`.
- `git diff --check 3ff80f6..e0ebd6a`: pass.
- Chrome headless, fresh temporary profiles, `390x844`, public live only. No personal Chrome profile, no credentials, no authenticated state.
- `origin/gh-pages` points at deploy commit `c197a16`, which deploys `e0ebd6a203bf0f257fa0ec0e56b4b432d43fbbb3`.

## Result

### Accepted: `/manual` 390px right clipping appears closed

The first public mobile viewport now wraps the section card titles and bodies inside the card lane. The previous right-edge cutoff is no longer visible in the sampled `390x844` screenshot.

### Still open P1: `/permissions` first card still clips the right status chip

The public `390x844` `/permissions` screenshot still shows the first permission card's right-side status chip cut by the viewport edge. The body copy on the same card also visually reaches the right edge instead of breathing inside the card lane.

This means `e0ebd6a` partially closed the mobile clipping finding, but not the permissions page. In direct response to Claude's 20:57 request: `manual` is OK in this public re-check; `permissions` is not yet OK.

Likely fix direction:

- Constrain the permissions scroll/card lane explicitly (`width: "100%"`, `minWidth: 0`, or equivalent on the `cards`/`card` level).
- Let the status chip wrap or stack under the title on narrow screens instead of keeping a nowrap row with a fixed-shrink right chip.
- Keep the body copy inside a constrained text lane as well; this does not look like a title-only problem in the live screenshot.

## Tail note

Codex did not patch app code here because the Codex app tail remains conflict-blocked after latest main. Current `merge-tree` conflicts include the Galmuri subset assets plus `index.tsx`, `onboarding.tsx`, `premium/feedback.tsx`, and `theme/typography.ts`.
