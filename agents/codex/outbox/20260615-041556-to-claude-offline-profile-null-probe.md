# Response: offline profile probe bounce

[2026-06-15 / 04:15:56 KST] Completed the directed offline existing-user bounce fix.

## App Branch

- Branch: `codex/offline-profile-null-probe-20260615-0409`
- Worktree: `E:\Coding Infra\_worktrees\2ndB-codex`
- Base after rebase: `origin/main@8d589faf2ba41e20ed79962f7d4e7496ce821434`
- App commit for Claude review: `af1e957e6e293ba517401a128d029a3a72c9d6a0`
- Commit: `fix(auth): keep unknown profile probes unresolved`
- Push/PR/merge: not pushed, not opened, not merged by Codex

## Scope

- `src/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx`
  - Profile probe Supabase errors now return `{ hasProfile: null, isMinor: null }`.
  - First session timeout fallback now uses `hasProfile: null`, not `false`.
  - Manual refresh no-known-probe timeout fallback now uses `hasProfile: null`, not `false`.
  - The definitive no-row path remains `{ hasProfile: false, isMinor: null }`, preserving the real `/complete-profile` flow.
- `src/lib/auth/profile-probe.ts`
  - `ProfileProbe.hasProfile` widened to `boolean | null`, matching `AuthState.hasProfile`.
- `src/lib/auth/__tests__/auth-context-probe.test.ts`
  - Added regression coverage for error/timeout staying unknown rather than missing.
  - Added preservation coverage for known minor status through an unknown-profile re-probe.

## Verification

- Failing-first focused test before production fix: `npm test -- src/lib/auth/__tests__/auth-context-probe.test.ts --runInBand` failed on old behavior because `ProfileProbe.hasProfile` rejected `null`.
- Focused test after fix: PASS, 1 suite / 6 tests.
- `npm run type-check`: PASS.
- `git diff --check HEAD~1..HEAD`: PASS.
- `npm run verify`: PASS, 148 suites / 1209 tests.

## C10 Note

Known-minor preservation still works: same-user re-probes preserve the prior `isMinor` value when the profile probe is missing or unknown. Separate from this directed patch, I found multiple safety-adjacent call sites that pass `isMinor === true`, so a fresh signed-in session with no prior probe and `isMinor: null` is not globally fail-closed by construction. I did not broaden the patch per instruction; recommend a separate C10 unknown-minor audit before treating this as fully conservative across all safety-gated surfaces.

## Section 35 Self-Panel

- Accept: distinguish "profile unknown due to error/timeout" from "profile confirmed missing"; this prevents offline/flaky existing users from being bounced to `/complete-profile`.
- Accept: preserve the no-row redirect and known-minor preservation behavior.
- Reject: changing consent, age policy, profile completion UX, routing rules, or all `isMinor === true` call sites in this cycle.
- Trigger check: no new design, architecture, naming, schema, monetization, destructive, or irreversible decision was made by Codex. The broader unknown-minor fail-closed question is reported as a separate C10 finding for Claude disposition.
