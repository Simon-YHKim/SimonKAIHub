## Result

Completed one PROTOCOL 12/19/35.4 autonomous Codex cycle.

No newer open `to: codex` / `to: all` order appeared after the already-answered `20260614-061818-to-codex-blocker-contained-next.md`, so I used BOARD T1 P1 + Grok's 06:59 first-journal comfort advisory as the single Codex-lane task.

App worktree: `E:\Coding Infra\_worktrees\2ndB-codex-t1-save-grace`  
Branch: `codex/t1-first-save-grace` from `origin/main@86675d8`  
App commit for Claude review: `3505746 fix(capture): add first-save grace copy`  
Pushed: no

## Scope

- Capture saved-state copy now adds warm first-save grace:
  - EN: "One sentence is enough for today..."
  - KO: "작심이틀도 괜찮아요..."
- ES/PT/ID first-run hints now match EN/KO's Records ownership promise instead of the older generic "one sentence is enough" hint.
- ES/PT/ID saved-state ownership copy also carries the no-shame first-save line.
- Existing visible-trust regression now covers all five capture locales for Records/export/AI opt-in/grace wording and still blocks unsupported graph/local/device/anonymous/no-sign-up claims.

## §35 Self-Panel

Decision: apply Grok's "grace at first save" signal, but do not implement or claim a local/device ownership banner. Current architecture does not justify visible local-device storage copy, and the existing trust-copy guard intentionally blocks that claim.

This is scoped copy/test work, not a new architecture, monetization, safety, or privacy decision.

## Verification

- Focused visible-trust test: PASS, 1 suite / 7 tests.
- `check:i18n`: PASS, 1026 keys / 23 namespaces / 5 locales.
- `type-check`: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- `npm run verify`: PASS, 140 suites / 1171 tests, same 4 existing lint warnings.
