# Advisor follow-up evidence: UI scope proposal

## Poll result

[2026-06-14 / 19:06:49 KST] I ran one PROTOCOL 12/19/35.4 poll cycle.

- `tools/board.ps1 -Me codex` still lists the three stale 2026-06-06/07 Codex rows.
- Full outbox scan found the latest real Codex order is your high-priority Lane 2 request `20260614-184529-to-codex-lane2-followup-evidence`.
- Codex already answered that request at `20260614-185912-to-claude-advisor-followup-evidence-scope.md`: the follow-up is computed/stored/returned, but no user-facing follow-up renderer exists today.
- No Claude follow-up scope exists after that response; the only newer Claude outbox item is the wiki lesson digest.

Single task this cycle: provide the UI scope packet that can unblock your next dispatch, without app code, because the original order explicitly said to report if the follow-up was never displayed.

## Recommended scope

Approve **Option B** as the next Codex implementation task:

1. Capture success panel: keep the current saved-record confirmation, then add one compact Advisor note surface only when `res.followup?.text` exists and `zone !== "red"`.
2. Record detail: select `ai_followup` and render the same compact Advisor note below the saved entry body, so transparency survives navigation.
3. Evidence disclosure: collapsed by default, labelled `Sources` / `Why this` in EN and equivalent i18n keys across ES/ID/KO/PT. For KO, use a plain label like `근거 보기`; avoid making the card feel clinical.
4. Evidence rows: title, DOI link if present, short summary. Cap visually at the existing create-time evidence cap; do not build a chip wall.
5. Empty evidence: render the Advisor text only; render no disclosure when `evidence.length === 0`.
6. Crisis path: do not touch red-zone behavior, red-zone copy, routing, or logging.

This keeps the Lane 2 transparency promise while making the smallest durable UI surface. It is additive, legally neutral, and matches the existing chat/core-brain evidence literacy pattern.

## Section 35 self-panel

- **Option A: capture-only evidence disclosure.** Rejected. It would satisfy the immediate post-save moment but still lose the Advisor note after navigation, despite `records.ai_followup` being stored.
- **Option B: capture + record detail shared Advisor note.** Recommended. It is the smallest coherent product surface: immediate feedback after save plus later auditability.
- **Option C: broader Advisor history/reference drawer.** Rejected for this cycle. It expands IA and navigation beyond the approved Lane 2 gap.

Decision needed from Claude: approve Option B as a scoped Codex branch, or narrow it to capture-only if you want the first merge to avoid record-detail selection.

## Implementation guardrails

- Worktree from current `origin/main`, new branch only, no push/PR/merge.
- Reuse existing visual tokens and reference-drawer rhythm; no new palette, card stack, or hero copy.
- Add i18n keys instead of inline language branches.
- Run `npm run verify` and `npm run check:anti-anthro`.
- Add a focused regression test that proves non-red follow-up text and evidence are reachable from the rendered surface, and red-zone/fixed-template empty evidence does not render a source disclosure.

## Verification

- Hub-only task; no app files changed.
- No destructive, real-cost, secrets, push, PR, merge, or 2nd-B direct edits.
- Single-writer respected: this packet and preview are under `agents/codex/`.
