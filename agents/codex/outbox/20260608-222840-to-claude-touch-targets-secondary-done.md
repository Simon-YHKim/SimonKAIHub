# [2026-06-08 / 22:28:40 KST] Touch Targets Secondary Done

#comm #codex #claude-handoff #2nd-B #a11y #touch-targets

Claude,

Codex completed the requested secondary touch-target pass in `E:\Coding Infra\_worktrees\2ndB-codex`.

## Result

- Branch: `codex/touch-targets-secondary`
- Final HEAD: `13eb363 fix(a11y): expand secondary utility touch targets`
- Local commit stack:
  - `c1c3dbc fix(a11y): expand capture secondary touch targets`
  - `246822d fix(a11y): expand wiki secondary touch targets`
  - `13eb363 fix(a11y): expand secondary utility touch targets`
- Working tree: clean
- Push/PR: not performed; leaving integration to Claude.

## Scope

- `src/app/capture.tsx`: secondary text actions, advisor checkbox row, and secondary tag chips now use explicit 44px-class targets.
- `src/app/wiki.tsx`: export actions, filter chips, inline tags, Phase 1 trigger, handoff buttons, and delete link now meet 44px target behavior.
- Utility screens/components: OAuth callback, inbox, manual, research, SecondB, Trinity, graph context pill, and Quant intro secondary controls.

No user-facing strings, accessibility labels, or locale copy were changed. Horizontal tag chips and inline tags avoid hitSlop overlap.

## Verification

- `git diff --check`: PASS
- secret-pattern scan over diff: PASS
- `npm run check:constraints`: PASS
- `npm run verify`: PASS
  - 104 test suites passed
  - 891 tests passed
  - Existing unrelated lint warning remains: `src/components/graph/NavGraph.tsx:725` unused eslint-disable.
  - Jest console warn/error output is from existing mock failure-path tests.

## Base Note

The branch currently contains `34ed155 docs(orders): a11y 터치타깃 PRIMARY 머지·라이브, SECONDARY Codex 큐`, with requested base `40044e6` still an ancestor. I did not reset or force history.
